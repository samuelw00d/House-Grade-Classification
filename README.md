# House-Grade-Classification

Property buyers have different requirements. To facilitate this, real estate companies prefer categorizing various houses into different grades based on various parameters. This would help agents in identifying the type of house a customer is looking for. This way, the search for the house can be narrowed down by focusing only on the ‘condition of the house’.

The Grade (condition of the house that ranges from A (Best) – E (Worst) ) can also be used by existing owners to list their properties for sale. Grading helps them in arriving at a price of the house.
